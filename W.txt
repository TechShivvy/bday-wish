Hi There,
Its Been 2 years of friendship with you in FIITJEE and you have been a great motivation to me. You are the only guy I have met so far who works day and night without rests(even no bathroom breaks). I appreciate your effort towards mastering a subject(That's the way how one should learn). You overcome your failures very easily and that's the lesson I learnt from you. I know you are worried most of the time but I am sure that you will reach great heights(maybe even Mt.Everst). Well you have not only been a good friend but a great example for a student. Talking about your age, Happy Birthday Dude, you are 18 now, so you got the right to drive any licensed car in Route 66(Just Kidding). Well my last words here. Be happy and Keep up with your work. This is Kabilan By the way :)

Hey Aravind ..
Happy birthday da !! 
Have a great year ahead.
Have always been jealous of your transformation. From a guy who randomly kept texting in Fiitjee freshers group to the most studiotic person in the class. 
Your persistence and hard work is impressive. All the best da! Hope you achieve what you want in life. Happy birthday again ! :)
